- Watts (1992) mentions the IP index by Karmel & MacLachlan (1988). This is

> IP = sum_i {| M_i - a_bar * T_i | } / T

Where 
> M_i 

is the local count of group M, 
> a_bar 

is the global share of group M

> T_i

is the local total in area i

> T

Is the total population overall. 

It was introducted in the context of occupational segregation by gender

- Waldorf (1992) mentions Jakubs (1891) and Morgan(1983)'s adaptation of the dissiminarity indiex to include a distance function

This takes on the form
> DBMI = min(D_obs) / min(D_ext)

Where 
> min(D_obs) 

is the minimum total relocation distance needed to transform the observed distirbution into the uniform distribution

And 
> min(D_ext)

Is the minimun total relocation distance necessary to transform the extreme of a completely segregated pattern into a uniform distribution
